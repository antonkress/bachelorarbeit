In this project, a real-time capable color sorting demonstrator is constructed. This is
capable of sorting test objects into different compartments according to their respective
color. For this purpose, an experimental setup was constructed that moves these test
objects through a tunnel by means of a conveyor belt. Inside this tunnel is a so-called
detection area in which image data are recorded under standardized conditions.
These image data are examined for the presence of a test object. If a test object
is detected within the image data, the image data runs through an algorithm that
recognizes the color of the test object.
At the end of the tunnel is a mechanical sort that is controlled based on the detected
color. A slider takes an appropriate position through which the analyzed test object is
moved to the correct compartment.
Throughout the process, the color sorting demonstrator is bound by timing constraints,
compliance with which is fundamental to the success of this work.
